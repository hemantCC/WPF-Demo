Assignment Goal:

 1. Interface
    Create an interface which differentiate between dynamic xaml windows and normal xaml windows
    Use interface instead of window instance to load windows in factory and singleton pattern
    Create an Interface which is used to change theme and font of application

 2. Dynamic Xaml file loading
    Create 4-5 Xaml files which contains some UI.
    Assign a unique identifier to that xaml file
    Create a Window in which when unique identifier is entered it dynamically loads UI in an area.

    Windows can be loaded in two ways
